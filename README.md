# Project Collect'IF

This is a school project. Collect'IF allows several people who wish to do the same activity to connect and to provide them with a room. This project was realised by Tristan Bourvon and Marc-Antoine Fernandes.

More precisely, the app allows its users to create an account, and then post a request for an activity. When there is enough people interested in an activity and a date, an event is created. This event must be approved by an admin who assign a location and eventually a price.
